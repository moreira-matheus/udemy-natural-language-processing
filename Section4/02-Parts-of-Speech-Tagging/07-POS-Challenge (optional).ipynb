    "# POS Challenge - OPTIONAL\n",
    "Just for fun, we've developed a game to test your knowledge of Part of Speech tags. The object of the game is to write a body of text that contains as many different ** *fine-grained tags* ** as possible. The highest possible score is 100 (or thereabouts). Points are awarded for the number of unique tags used, and for the fewest possible tokens used. Below is an example. Feel free to post your results in the Q&A Forum for this lecture, and good luck!"
